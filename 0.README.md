At its core, An Internal Developer Platform provides automated self-service solutions for developers to simplify and standardize software practices, infrastructure, environments, and operations. In order to better understand the use and benefits of "Internal Developer Platforms" and Platform Engineering, feel free to refer to the following links (websites and video(s)):

# Introduction

Powered by Kubernetes and AWS (or any other cloud provider), Hydra is both an Internal & External Developer Platform. Customers are able to build, test, deploy, monitor, and scale containerized applications on the cloud via CLI and Web UI requests to API Gateways (REST) installed on each cluster. Internal Developers are able to do much more with direct access to Clusters. All solutions presented in this Vault pertain to "self-hosted" services, as opposed to managed services e.g AWS: EKS, NLB, ALB, etc.

##### Note:

By any standards, Hydra is an over-engineered project. The following list of tools is segmented into essential & priority levels on another document located [[Prioritized List of Tools (with descriptions)|here]]. Despite the long list of tools, many are in truth, required. For example, to provide observability into applications (logs, metrics, traces, continuous profiling), a myriad of tools are required to complete the observability stack.

**Observability Stack:**

- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) to collect Logs/Metrics/Traces via CDK and Helm Install on clusters

- [Grafana Agent](https://github.com/grafana/agent) (flow mode)Â is a telemetry collector for sending metrics, logs, and trace data to the opinionated Grafana observability stack.

- [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) to store OpenTelemetry logs in long-term horizontally scalable, highly available, and object storage-based multi-tenant log aggregation system.

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to collect OpenTelemetry metrics

- [Mimir](https://grafana.com/oss/mimir/) to store metrics in long-term horizontally scalable object storage. 

- [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) to store Traces in long-term horizontally scalable object storage.

- [Pyroscope](https://pyroscope.io/) to store Continuous Profiling data in long-term horizontally scalable object storage. 

- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to display charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to the aforementioned data sources.

### The Goal of Hydra:

To provide the "golden" software development ecosystem to developers and to provide a streamlined interface for deploying & managing applications. Software has evolved.
