# Prelude

To better understand Hydra, the hybrid Internal & External Developer Platform, it's important that we separate the functionality that is offered to "external" and "internal" developers.

### External Developers (customers)

External Developers, aka customers, interact with Hydra via UI or CLI. The only functionality they have is what we've explicitly configured via API Gateway. This interface will offer streamlined functionality centered around "applications" to reduce complexity. The ability to deploy, test, scale, and monitor applications.
### Internal Developers

Internal Developers are developers that belong to our organization. They can interact with the Kubernetes cluster(s) directly (different tiers of permissions exist, built upon least-privilege access policies), and access the various UIs of tools installed on the cluster. 


There will always be more functionality offered to Internal Developers, as the product we offer External Developers (customers) is a smaller curated subset of battle-tested & secure functionality that we approve.

# Business Plan for Hydra

### Hydra: Empowering Developers, Unleashing Innovation

In the modern world, software development is at the heart of enterprise success. Enterprises that can effectively harness the power of software development enjoy a competitive edge. Hydra, at its core, is an Internal Developer Platform. It is purpose-built to provide our developers with an optimal software development ecosystem, enabling them to innovate and create cutting-edge solutions. Simultaneously, Hydra offers a commercialized version that extends a curated subset of our internal platform's capabilities as a service, empowering businesses (solo developers, small-medium businesses, and enterprise) to tap into this ecosystem.

### The Imperative Checklist for Software Development in 2023

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Keep pace with automated testing and seamless code integration or risk getting buried under manual workflows.
    
2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Embrace automated deployments to stay ahead; manual deployments can be a bottleneck.
    
3. **Microservices** (optional): Split your monolith now; or later, struggle with scaling and adaptability.
    
4. **Containers**: Dive into containerization or face compatibility woes and deployment nightmares.
    
5. **Orchestration**: Kubernetes is the kingpin; don't let your orchestration fall apart.
    
6. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Script your infrastructure for consistency, else deal with chaos.
    
7. **Logging & Monitoring**: Proactive monitoring or constant firefighting, you choose.
    
8. **Alerting**: Detect issues promptly or wait for users to report them.
    
9. **Security as Code**: Bake security into your pipeline; neglect security at your own risk.
    
10. **Scalability**: Prepare to scale horizontally or prepare for the consequences.
    
11. **Load Balancing**: Balance traffic gracefully; or crash under peak loads.
    
12. **Caching**: Optimize your cache strategy; otherwise, watch your app crawl.
    
13. **Auto-Scaling**: Adapt to traffic patterns, or see your app crumble under spikes.
    
14. **Backup & Recovery**: Have a solid backup plan, or face data loss nightmares.
    
15. **Blue-Green or Canary Deployments**: Orchestrate seamless releases, or risk downtime disasters.
    
16. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Update your infrastructure game; or suffer configuration drift.
    
17. **Secrets Management**: Keep your secrets safe; or invite a security breach.
    
18. **Dependency Management**: Efficiently manage dependencies; or face version chaos.
    
19. **API-First Design**: Open standards and clear documentation, or alienate developers.
    
20. **Testing Strategies**: Thorough testing is your shield; or risk releasing bugs.
    
21. **GitOps**: Automate operations; or swim in manual management inefficiency.
    
22. **Compliance & Governance**: Stay compliant or face hefty penalties and legal issues.
    
23. **Cloud-Native**: Embrace the cloud for elasticity, cost-effectiveness, or run expensive data centers.
    
24. **Self-Service Environments**: Enable developers to provision environments; or waste time on requests.
    
25. **Collaboration Tools**: Foster team communication and collaboration; or deal with silos.
    
26. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date; or watch knowledge silos grow.
    
27. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize consistently; or let your app slow down.
