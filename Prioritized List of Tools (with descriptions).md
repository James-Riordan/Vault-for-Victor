### kube-iptables-tailer

kube-iptables-tailer is a service that gives you better visibility on networking issues in your Kubernetes cluster by detecting the traffic denied by iptables and surfacing corresponding information to the affected Pods via Kubernetes events.

kube-iptables-tailer itself runs as a Pod in your cluster, and it keeps watching changes on iptables log file [mounted from the host](https://github.com/box/kube-iptables-tailer#mounting-iptables-log-file). If traffic from/to a Pod is denied by your iptables rules, iptables will drop the packet and record a log entry on the host with relevant information. kube-iptables-tailer is able to detect these changes, and then it will try locating both the senders and receivers (as running Pods in your cluster) by their IPs. For IPs that do not match any Pods in your cluster, a DNS lookup will be performed to get subjects involved in the packet drops.

As the result, kube-iptables-tailer will submit an event in nearly real-time to the Pod located successfully inside your cluster. The Pod owners can thence be aware of iptables packet drops
