## What is Grafana Tanka (Jsonnet)?

Grafana Tanka, often referred to as Tanka, is a powerful and flexible open-source tool that enables Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps for Kubernetes. Tanka is built around the Jsonnet configuration language and designed to make managing Kubernetes configurations easier and more efficient. Jsonnet is a data templating language that allows you to describe your desired Kubernetes configurations in a structured and reusable way.

Here are some key aspects of Grafana Tanka and Jsonnet:

- **Declarative Configuration**: Tanka uses Jsonnet to define Kubernetes configurations declaratively. This means you can express what you want your infrastructure to look like without worrying about the imperative steps to achieve it.

- **GitOps Workflow**: Tanka encourages a GitOps workflow where your entire configuration is versioned in a Git repository. This approach allows you to track changes, collaborate with your team, and easily rollback to previous configurations if needed.

- **Composition and Abstraction**: Jsonnet provides the ability to create reusable components and abstractions, making it easier to manage complex Kubernetes configurations and maintain consistency across different environments.

- **Extensibility**: Tanka is highly extensible, allowing you to integrate with other Kubernetes tools and extend its functionality as needed.


## Why Use Grafana Tanka (Jsonnet) in Your Internal Developer Platform?

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Tanka allows you to define your infrastructure as code, making it easier to manage, version, and replicate your Kubernetes configurations. With a declarative approach, you can specify what your infrastructure should look like, and Tanka will ensure it stays in that desired state.

### 2. Version Control and Collaboration

By using GitOps with Tanka, your entire Kubernetes configuration is stored in a version-controlled Git repository. This enables effective collaboration among your team members, as changes can be reviewed and tracked, and you can easily roll back to previous configurations if issues arise.

Jsonnet's capabilities for composing and abstracting configurations help ensure consistency across different environments. You can create reusable components and templates, reducing duplication and potential errors in your configurations.

### 4. Flexibility and Extensibility

Tanka is highly extensible and can be integrated with other Kubernetes tools, such as Helm and Kustomize, to further customize and extend your deployment processes. This flexibility allows you to adapt Tanka to your specific needs and workflow.

### 5. Simplified Management

Tanka simplifies the management of complex Kubernetes configurations by providing a structured and modular way to define your infrastructure. This makes it easier to troubleshoot and maintain your Kubernetes deployments.


## Why Jsonnet Instead of YAML?

Managing Kubernetes configurations using Jsonnet, as opposed to traditional YAML, offers several advantages:

### 1. Abstraction and Reusability

Jsonnet allows you to create abstractions and reusable components, which can significantly reduce duplication in your configurations. With Jsonnet, you can define variables, functions, and libraries, making it easier to maintain consistency and minimize errors across your Kubernetes configurations.

### 2. Concise and Readable Code

Jsonnet's concise and expressive syntax makes it easier to write and understand complex configurations. It provides the flexibility to create dynamic and data-driven configurations, making your code more maintainable and human-readable.

### 3. Composition and Modularization

Jsonnet enables modularization by breaking down configurations into smaller, manageable pieces. This approach promotes better organization, as you can compose configurations from different modules, reducing the complexity of individual YAML files.

### 4. Conditional Logic

Jsonnet supports conditional logic, allowing you to define configurations that adapt to different environments or scenarios. This is particularly useful for handling multiple Kubernetes clusters or configurations with variations.

### 5. Version Control and Code Reusability

Jsonnet configurations can be versioned in Git, promoting a GitOps workflow. This makes it easier to track changes, collaborate with team members, and reuse configurations across multiple projects.

In summary, Jsonnet offers a more powerful and expressive way to manage Kubernetes configurations, providing greater flexibility, code reusability, and maintainability compared to traditional YAML.

## Why Manage Helm Chart Values with Tanka?

Tanka provides an excellent way to manage Helm chart values in a GitOps-oriented Kubernetes workflow. Here's why it's beneficial:

### 1. GitOps Consistency

Using Tanka to manage Helm chart values ensures that your Helm releases remain consistent with your declarative GitOps approach. This means you can version and track changes to your Helm chart values alongside other Kubernetes configurations in your Git repository.

### 2. Declarative Values

Tanka allows you to declare Helm chart values in a declarative way, aligning with the rest of your Kubernetes configurations. This ensures that your entire infrastructure, including Helm releases, is defined in a consistent, declarative manner.

### 3. Reusability and Composition

With Tanka, you can create reusable Helm value configurations, making it easier to apply consistent values to multiple Helm releases. Additionally, you can compose Helm value sets from different modules, promoting modularization and reducing duplication.

### 4. Version Control and Auditing

By managing Helm chart values in Git repositories alongside your Jsonnet configurations, you gain the ability to track changes, audit historical values, and roll back to previous configurations if necessary. This is crucial for maintaining a secure and controlled deployment process.

### 5. Integration with Helm

Tanka seamlessly integrates with Helm, allowing you to leverage the Helm ecosystem's extensive library of charts while maintaining the benefits of GitOps and declarative configurations. You can manage Helm releases and values alongside other Kubernetes resources easily.

In conclusion, managing Helm chart values with Tanka enhances the GitOps approach to infrastructure management by ensuring consistency, version control, and declarative configuration across your Kubernetes environment. This approach simplifies the Helm release process and makes it more compatible with your GitOps workflows.
